# Integrate Oracle 23ai Vector DB with OCI GenAI using Llama-index

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11.x-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

## Introduction

Accessing the right answers from vast data repositories is a challenge many organizations face. A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based system can revolutionize how users interact with their data by making information easily accessible and up-to-date. In this workshop, weâ€™ll build a RAG-based chatbot using **Oracle Database 23ai** and **OCI Generative AI** services, allowing users to chat with their unstructured data like PDF, CSV, and TXT files. This approach combines advanced retrieval techniques with generative AI, creating a powerful solution for intelligent and dynamic data interaction.


## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines retrieval-based methods with generative AI to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses by accessing and utilizing large datasets dynamically. [Learn more about RAG](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/).

## Prerequisites and Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Oracle Cloud Account**  
  [Sign up here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)
  
- **Oracle Database 23AI**  
  [Learn more](https://www.oracle.com/database/23ai/)
  
- **Compute VM**  
  This will serve as your web app. Ensure the Compute VM can communicate with the Oracle Database by setting up the appropriate network configurations.
  
- **OCI Generative AI Services**  
  [Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GenerativeAI/home.htm)
  
- **LlamaIndex**  
  [Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/llama-index/)
  
- **Python Dependencies**  
  Listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the repository.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository in your web server (Compute VM)

```bash
sudo dnf install git

git clone https://github.com/SaurabhSalunkhe/Oracle-23ai-RAG-Chatbot.git
```

### 2. Update and Install Dependencies (Oracle Linux)
```
sudo yum update -y && sudo yum install -y git python3 && sudo yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools" && sudo yum install -y bzip2-devel openssl-devel libffi-devel zlib-devel wget libffi-devel openssl openssl-devel tk-devel xz-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel readline-devel libuuid-devel ncurses-devel libaio

```

### 3. Install Python 3.11.x
Ensure Python version 3.11.x is installed.

```
mkdir -p $HOME/python
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/Python-3.11.0.tgz
tar -xvzf Python-3.11.0.tgz --strip-components=1 -C /home/$USER/python
cd $HOME/python
./configure --prefix=$HOME/python
./configure --enable-optimizations
make clean; make
make altinstall

export PYTHONHOME=$HOME/python
export PATH=$PYTHONHOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PYTHONHOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

cd $HOME/python/bin
ln -s python3.11 python3
ln -s pip3.11 pip3

```

### 4. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```
cd Oracle-23ai-RAG-Chatbot
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install Python Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Configure OCI Authentication
a. Create the .oci Directory

```
mkdir -p /home/opc/.oci
```

b. Generate OCI API Keys
Follow the OCI SDK Configuration Guide to generate your API keys.
https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm 

https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#apisigningkey_topic_How_to_Generate_an_API_Signing_Key_Console 

### 7. Set Up Oracle Database 23ai
a. Run SQL Commands from create_tables.sql
Create the User and Grant Privileges

```
-- Create the user with a specified password
CREATE USER ai_user IDENTIFIED BY "EXamplepassword#_123";

-- Grant DBA privileges for full administrative access
GRANT DBA TO ai_user;

-- Grant specific roles and privileges needed for Oracle AI Vector Search
GRANT DB_DEVELOPER_ROLE TO ai_user;
GRANT CREATE MINING MODEL TO ai_user;
```

As ai_user, Create Tables with Vector Data Types


```
CREATE TABLE BOOKS (
    ID NUMBER NOT NULL,
    NAME VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

CREATE TABLE CHUNKS (
    ID VARCHAR2(64) NOT NULL,
    CHUNK CLOB,
    VEC VECTOR(1024, FLOAT64),
    PAGE_NUM VARCHAR2(10),
    BOOK_ID NUMBER,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID),
    CONSTRAINT fk_book
        FOREIGN KEY (BOOK_ID)
        REFERENCES BOOKS (ID)
);
```

8. Configure the Application
a. Edit config.py
Update the following parameters with your details:

```
# DB connections (Below are example credentials. Substitute with your credentials)
DB_USER = "ai_user"
DB_PWD = "EXamplepassword#_123"
DB_HOST_IP = "ip:1521"
DB_SERVICE = "example_PDB1.sub07260203110.vcnss.oraclevcn.com"

# GenAI configurations
COMPARTMENT_OCID = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..xxxxxxxxx"
ENDPOINT = "https://inference.generativeai.us-chicago-1.oci.oraclecloud.com"
COHERE_API_KEY = "xxxxxxxxxxx"  # Optional but recommended
```

### 8. Run the Streamlit Application

```
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
streamlit run app.py
```

### 9. To Run the App in the Background

```
nohup streamlit run app.py &
```

### 10. Access the Chatbot
Open your browser and navigate to http://<Your_VM_IP>:8501.

You should see the chatbot interface as shown below:
