# Cash Withdrawal: Withdrawing Cash from an ATM

## About this workshop

This article explores the capabilities of Meta Llama models on Oracle Cloud and Oracle Database 23ai, demonstrating how to access and utilize these powerful AI tools for various applications. 

The article covers the following topics:

- Accessing and generating text using Meta Llama models, including creating job descriptions, product pitches, and emails. 
- Viewing and developing applications using the model's code.
- Leveraging the Meta Llama vision instruct model to read image contents.
- Integrating Oracle Database with Meta Llama models for enhanced functionality.
- Setting up Oracle APEX OCI web credentials to call Generative AI services.
- Converting text to audio input using OCI Speech (Text To Speech) services.

By following the steps outlined in this article, developers and users can unlock the full potential of Meta Llama models and Oracle Database 23ai on Oracle Cloud, enabling them to build innovative applications and solutions that harness the power of generative AI.

Oracle and Meta have a partnership that allows Meta to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to train and deploy its Llama large language models (LLMs). Oracle also helps Meta develop AI agents based on Llama models. 

OCI Generative AI now supports the pretrained Meta Llama 3.1 70 billion-parameter and 405 billion-parameter large language models. These models support eight languages, including English, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai and have a context length of 128,000 tokens, which is 16 times more than their previous Meta Llama 3 models.

Llama 3.1 405B is the first openly available model that rivals the top AI models when it comes to state-of-the-art capabilities in general knowledge, steerability, math, tool use, and multilingual translation. With the release of the 405B model, we’re poised to supercharge innovation—with unprecedented opportunities for growth and exploration. We believe the latest generation of Llama will ignite new applications and modeling paradigms, including synthetic data generation to enable the improvement and training of smaller models, as well as model distillation—a capability that has never been achieved at this sc

## Task 1: Access Meta.llama-3.1-70b-instruct on Oracle Cloud

1. Prompt the OCI Generative AI chat models to generate text. You can ask questions in natural language and optionally submit text such as documents, emails, and product reviews to the chat models. Each model reasons over the text and provides intelligent answers. 

2. Login to cloud.oracle.com, choose a region where Oracle Generative AI Services are available, for example Chicago region, and from the top Navigation, 

  Select Analytics & AI > AI Services > Generative AI as shown below

    ```java 
        <copy>
        import oci

        # Setup basic variables
        # Auth Config
        # TODO: Please update config profile name and use the compartmentId that has policies grant permissions for using Generative AI Service
        compartment_id = "<Your-Compartment-OCID>"
        CONFIG_PROFILE = "DEFAULT"
        config = oci.config.from_file('~/.oci/config', CONFIG_PROFILE)

        # Service endpoint
        endpoint = "https://inference.generativeai.us-chicago-1.oci.oraclecloud.com"

        generative_ai_inference_client = oci.generative_ai_inference.GenerativeAiInferenceClient(config=config, service_endpoint=endpoint, retry_strategy=oci.retry.NoneRetryStrategy(), timeout=(10,240))
        chat_detail = oci.generative_ai_inference.models.ChatDetails()

        content = oci.generative_ai_inference.models.TextContent()
        content.text = "Generate a product pitch for a USB connected compact microphone that can record surround sound"
        message = oci.generative_ai_inference.models.Message()
        message.role = "USER"
        message.content = [content]
        chat_request = oci.generative_ai_inference.models.GenericChatRequest()
        chat_request.api_format = oci.generative_ai_inference.models.BaseChatRequest.API_FORMAT_GENERIC
        chat_request.messages = [message]

        print("**************************Chat Result**************************")
        print(vars(chat_response))
        </copy>
    ```
     
## Task 4: Access Meta.llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct on Oracle Cloud
 
1. For some models, you can submit images and ask questions about the image.
3. Select Meta.llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct model, let us drag and drop an image of apple in the Gen AI playground. 
  
  ![ATM Cash withdrawal](images/atm-9.png)
    
## Task 5: Read the contents of an Image
 
1.  Upload Image and also provide input prompt as shown below
    
    ```text 
        <copy>
        Prompt: What is the card number?
        </copy>
    ```  
2. Based on the Image uploaded and prompt, we can get card number printed
   
   ![ATM Cash withdrawal](images/atm-12.png)

   Now that we know how to get information from an image, we can use this data to query from the Oracle Autonomous Database

## Task 6: How do you set up Oracle APEX OCI Web credentials and call Generative AI services?
 
1.  Please see Lab 2 and Task 7 on How to setup Oracle APEX OCI Web credentials
  
## Task 7: Leveraging Oracle Database with Meta Llama Models
 
1.  Let us take an example of how we can find customer information based on the card number read through the Meta Llama Vision model.
2.  The Response would be card number, Based on the card number card holder name and card status can be pulled from the Database. 
   
    ![ATM Cash withdrawal](images/atm-13.png)

3. Create a Simple Cards table, to hold card and customer information

    ```sql 
      <copy>
    CREATE TABLE "CC_FD" 
      (	
          "ID" NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 
          9999999 INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1 CACHE 20 NOORDER  NOCYCLE  NOKEEP  NOSCALE  NOT NULL ENABLE, 
          "CUST_ID" NUMBER,  -- Customer Id
          "CC_NO" NUMBER, -- Card Number
          "STATUS" VARCHAR2(50), 
          "VALIDITY" DATE, 
          "FIRST_NAME" VARCHAR2(50), 
          "LAST_NAME" VARCHAR2(50), 
          "BANK_NAME" VARCHAR2(50),  
          PRIMARY KEY ("ID")
          USING INDEX  ENABLE
      ) ;
      </copy>
    ```

4. PL/SQL reads card information from an image uploaded and gets the customer details from a database table, and generates Audio response

    ```sql 
      <copy>

## Task 9: Conclusion
 
1.  The ability to read image content, query the database on that content extracted, create alerts and push notifications, detect fraud in real time, make instant decisions, and run it in a multi-cloud environment opens tremendous opportunities in the world of enterprise business and AI itself. Looking forward to more of these emerging AI and Database innovations.
