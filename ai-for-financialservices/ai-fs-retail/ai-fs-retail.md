1. Design Database for Pizza Items, Pizza Orders and Pizza Order Items
2. Create table **PIZZASHOPS** will all food items, Image column is used to save image location url
  
    ```sql 
        <copy>
        CREATE TABLE "PIZZASHOPS" 
        (	
          "ID" NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 99999999999 
          INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1 CACHE 20 NOORDER  NOCYCLE  NOKEEP  NOSCALE  NOT NULL ENABLE, 
          "ADDRESS" VARCHAR2(255), 
          "CITY" VARCHAR2(50),
