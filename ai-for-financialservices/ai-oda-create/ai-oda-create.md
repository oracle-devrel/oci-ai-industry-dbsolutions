## Task 1: Log into OCI

1. Login into OCI

    To setup environment, you need OCI administrator's privileges. If you've got these privileges, login into OCI at [cloud.oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html). the below image indicates SSO Login as an administrative user. If you have administrative privileges and complete access over a tenancy then you need not create any of the policies below steps.

                // Provide translations for the strings used in the widget
                en: {                                   
                    // en locale, can be configured for any locale
                    chatTitle: 'Ask Sam'
